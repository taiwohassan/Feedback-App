# Feedback Project

This React project is designed to enhance the understanding and mastery of fundamental React concepts, including the use of props, useState hooks, useRef, and React Router.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a simple feedback application that allows users to submit feedback on reviews about a product or service.
It provides a practical playground for strengthening my  skills in managing state with useState, passing data through props, utilizing useRef 
for handling forms, and implementing navigation using React Router.

## Key Features

- **Feedback Form:** Create a feedback form where users can submit their feedback on different topics.
  
- **State Management:** Utilize the useState hook to manage the state of the application and update UI components dynamically.

- **Props Passing:** Practice passing data between components using props to ensure a seamless flow of information.

- **Form Handling with useRef:** Implement form handling using the useRef hook to efficiently manage form input.

- **React Router Integration:** Incorporate React Router to create a multi-page application with smooth navigation between different views.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **src/components:** Contains individual React components.
  
- **src/pages:** Includes different pages/views of the application, each managed by React Router.

- **src/App.js:** The main component where React Router routes are defined.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taiwohassan/Feedback-App.git

   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```



## Learning Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of React state management with useState.
